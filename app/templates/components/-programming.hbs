 I have created applications in Java, C++, Python, and HTML/Javascript including nodejs.  Some of these applications are available on  {{#link-to "projects"}}this site{{/link-to}} while others are available on my <a href="https://github.com/phillyfan1138/"> github</a> page.  These applications range from an <a href="https://github.com/phillyfan1138/BinomialTree">automatic recombining tree class for any single dimensional stochastic differential equation</a> to creating an <a href="https://github.com/phillyfan1138/DuneClient">interface</a> between <a href="http://emby.media/">emby</a> and the <a href="http://www.dune-hd-usa.com/">Dune Media Player</a>.  Additionally I have a working knowledge of SAS, VBA, and VB.net.
