I have a strong interest in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.  Financial instutions will be forced by competitive pressures to streamline and innovate.  Blockchain technology promises to be the optimal means by which this innovation will occur.  Transactions can be automated and are fully auditable.  Aside from huge cost savings, strong internal controls will be inherent in the blockchain process.  Cryptocurrencies can finally break central banks' monopolies on monetary policy.
