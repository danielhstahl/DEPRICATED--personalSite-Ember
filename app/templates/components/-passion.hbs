I have a goal of creating a parsimonious economic capital model that is both actionable and accurate.  Actionable models have intuitive results for various economic and bank specific scenarios with output that can be used to improve risk-based performance while providing timely results.  Accurate models use assumptions that are close approximations of the actual data generating process.  In the economic capital space, accurate models typically require CPU intensive Monte Carlo simulations.  Many Monte Carlo implementations fail to meet the goal of providing timely results.  One method to circumvent Monte Carlo computation uses characteristic functions to efficiently blend market, operational, credit risk, and liquidity risk while retaining accuracy.  I have written two papers which demonstrate this technique for <a href='assets/pdf/CreditRiskPaper.pdf'>credit risk</a> and <a href='assets/pdf/OpsRiskPaper.pdf'>operational risk</a>.
