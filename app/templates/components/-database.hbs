I have extensive experience in designing and creating databases in SQL Server.  At my previous job I created a data warehouse which captured and retained all loan data.  This enabled more advanced analytics including seasoning analysis and time to default analysis.  Additionally, the availability of this data enabled economic capital and ALLL calculations to be computed in seconds instead of the days of data gathering that previously was required.  In my current position, I have designed, implemented, and tracked our workflow around data tests.  To this end I have created an extensive infrastructure with dozens of normalized and interlinked tables.  This enables automated workflows, automated documentation generation, and clever visualizations showing the inter-relationships between all the tables.
