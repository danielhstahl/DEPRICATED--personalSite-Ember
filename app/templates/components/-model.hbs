I have created credit and operational economic capital models as can be seen in the {{#link-to 'research'}}research{{/link-to}} section of this site.  I also have created ad-hoc projects (including a full market risk model) some of which can be found in the {{#link-to 'projects'}}projects{{/link-to}} section.  At my previous job I created the ALLL and economic capital models.  The economic capital model used <a href='http://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.2542.pdf'>Euler's </a> method to push economic capital to each loan in the portfolio.  Each of these models was written in Java and had a GUI which allowed non-technical users to price loans and analyze risk.
