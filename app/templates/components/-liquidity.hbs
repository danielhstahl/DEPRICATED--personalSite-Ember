The biggest risk to a financial institution is a lack of liquidity.  A bank may be well capitalized, have good cash flow, and even be profitable. But a sudden draw on liabilities caused either by the withdrawal from a single large client or a systemic withdrawal by many smaller clients can render a bank insolvent regardless of these other factors.  My published paper on credit risk features a semi-endogenous liquidity event that increases in probability as credit losses increases.  A unpublished follow up to that paper describes in more detail how the liquidity capital should be applied to the loan level.  Both these papers can be found in the {{#link-to 'research'}}research{{/link-to}} section of this site.
